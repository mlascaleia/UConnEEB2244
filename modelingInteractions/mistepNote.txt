You may be experiencing an issue in your class where the time lag isn't working as it should
Basically, when r * tau is just slightly more than 1.57 (i.e. 1.6) you should see stable limit cycles
But instead what you see is still dampened oscilations.
This comes from the fact that the resolution of the lines in this program are 1/10 of a timestep

Other programs are much better coded, and so they can run at much higher resolution (i.e. 1/1000 of a timestep) which eliminates this issue
If you want to set "minstep" in the code to be something less than .1 go ahead,
Just know that it might slow the program down! It's a tradeoff
