# UConnEEB2244
Code that is used as the backend for certain discussion activity in UConn's General Ecology Course

Dear Future TAs,
I wrote this all and some (many) of my coding quirks are present. If you have a question about anything you can:
  1. Ask Miranda for my contact info and email me
  2. Create an issue in this repository
  3. Google me (Michael LaScaleia) and use the email you find there
