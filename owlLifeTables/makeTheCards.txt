Alright so getting from owls.csv to the word document with the actual cards is complicated, but the way I did it is with a mail merge.

The word document with the cards should be on HuskyCT (it's wayyyy too big to put on github).

This was a pain in the butt and if you want to try to make new cards with new probabilities, I wouldn't try to do it yourself.

Honestly, just ask Miranda for my personal phone number and call me. We'll talk about how to do a mail merge.

Or search how to do a mail merge, and godspeed.
